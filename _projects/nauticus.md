During the summer before my final quarter in Northwestern University's MSR program, I am working as a software engineering intern at [Nauticus Robotics](https://nauticusrobotics.com/). Their mission is to push marine robotics forward with autonomy and reliability in an environmentally sustainable fashion. I'm very excited to be a part of it, and I'm looking forward to updating this page with more info on this incredible experience!
