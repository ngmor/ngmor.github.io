For my final project in Northwestern University's MSR program, I worked with the unique [**omnidirectional mobile cobots**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2022/08/mobile-cobots-offer-glimpse-of-future-of-human-robot-interaction/), dubbed "omnid mocobots" or "omnids" for short. These collaborative robots were developed at Northwestern University by [**Elwin et al.**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14293).

A portion of the project involved [upgrading the omnids' onboard systems](/projects/omnid-mocobots), but the main goal of the project was to research novel ways to apply **assistive action prediction using generative machine learning models**.
