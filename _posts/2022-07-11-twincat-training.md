During my time with the automation team at DMC, Inc, I became somewhat of a subject matter expert with Beckhoff's TwinCAT 3 platform.

One of DMC's core values with which I'm passionately aligned is "sharing information." During my time at DMC, the company's Beckhoff services grew quite a bit in size, and necessarily so did our expertise. I wanted to make sure, as our team of Beckhoff-capable engineers grew, that we likewise expanded our documentation and internal training material to make it easier and easier to bring new members onto that team. I also wanted to contribute what I could to the Beckhoff development community with public information that could be used by anyone trying to get into Beckhoff PLC programming.

For these reasons, I made sure to take note of the topics and items I wish I knew when I was first learning TwinCAT 3. Using that list, I utilized what extra time I had in between developing for my clients to write internal training material and publish public reference blogs.

Towards the end of my tenure with DMC, the training material I contributed to was used to ramp engineers straight out of school into contributing to client TwinCAT 3 projects within 1 month of starting at the company.

Several of my public blogs were well received, garnering high time on page and low bounce rates from visitors, indicating the material was worthwhile and kept them on the company's website.

I'll elaborate about the blog topics soon!
